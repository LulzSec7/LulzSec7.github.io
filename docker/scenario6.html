<h1><a id="Scenario6_Ignoring_Files_0"></a>Scenario-6: Ignoring Files</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>In this scenario, we’ll explore how you can ignore certain files from ending up inside a Docker image that can introduce security risks. This scenario also investigates how you can reduce the build time by ignoring which files are sent to the Docker Build Context.</p>

<h2><a id="Step_1__Docker_Ignore_3"></a>Step 1 - Docker Ignore</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To prevent sensitive files or directories from being included by mistake in images, you can add a file named .dockerignore.<br>
A Dockerfile copies the working directory into the Docker Image. As a result, this would include potentially sensitive information such as a passwords file which we’d want to manage outside the image. View the Dockerfile with</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cat Dockerfile
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Build the image with</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker build -t password .
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at the output using</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker run password ls /app
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This will include the passwords file.<br>
The following command would include passwords.txt in our .dockerignore file and ensure that it didn’t accidentally end up in a container.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> passwords.txt &gt;&gt; .dockerignore
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Now Build the image, because of the Docker Ignore file it shouldn’t include the passwords file.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker build -t nopassword .
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Look at the output using</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker run nopassword ls /app
</code></pre>

<h2><a id="Step_2__Docker_Build_Context_31"></a>Step 2 - Docker Build Context</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the environment, a 100M temporary file has been created. This file is never used by the Dockerfile. When you execute a build command, Docker sends the entire path contents to the Engine for it to calculate which files to include. As a result sending the 100M file is unrequired and creates a slower build.<br>
You can see the 100M impact by executing following the command.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">docker build -t large-file-context .
</code></pre>

<h2><a id="Step_3__Optimised_Build_38"></a>Step 3 - Optimised Build</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To speed up our build, simply include the filename of the large file in the ignore file.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> big-temp-file.img &gt;&gt; .dockerignore
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>When we rebuild the image, it will be much faster as it doesn’t have to copy the 100M file.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker build -t no-large-file-context .
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This optimisation has a greater impact when ignoring large directories such as .git.</p>
